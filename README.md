Predicting Dengue Fever in San Juan and Iquitos

https://www.drivendata.org/competitions/44/dengai-predicting-disease-spread/

Problem: Predict how many (if any) mosquitos with dengue will be found in a city in a given month based on time, weather, and geographic factors

Current plan:
- Figure out what the pixels from city centroid means
- Polynomial Features the weather data
- Neural Network everything forever (or just on the pixels)
- Use neural network results on pixels as a feature to build a regression from the rest of the data
