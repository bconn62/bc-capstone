Predicting Dengue Fever in San Juan and Iquitos

https://www.drivendata.org/competitions/44/dengai-predicting-disease-spread/

Problem: Predict how many (if any) mosquitos with dengue will be found in a city in a given month based on time, weather, and geographic factors

This is the repo for the final project of the data science immersive course. For this project I wanted to try to throw everything I've learned about data science and python coding at a global health problem. This project includes data cleaning and inputation, regression models, neural networks, hyperparameter tuning, and custom functions and for-loops. 

A blog post about the process and results of the project can be found here: https://medium.com/@bconn992/dengue-fever-and-how-to-predict-it-a32eab1dbb18
